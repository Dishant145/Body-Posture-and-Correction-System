# Body-Posture-and-Correction-System-Using-Python-and-Flask


This project was motivated by a desire to improve the lifestyle of people who have to sit in front of systems for prolonged hours.

- Implemented a system which monitors the sitting posture of the user continuously via a live video feed.
- System alerts the user if the posture is incorrect or they are sitting in front of the screen for a long time.
- User has choice to choose voice/text alert or both.
- Can monitor both front and side view of the user.
- Programming Language/Frameworks: Python, Flask, Computer Vision (OpenCV), Pose Estimation Model (MediaPipe).
